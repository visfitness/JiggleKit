# JiggleKit

## Overview

``JiggleKit`` is a revolutionary SwiftUI package that enables your `Views` to jiggle, like the iPhone home screen "jiggle mode". It has been developed by Vis Fitness for implementing a jiggle-mode-like functionality in our upcoming [Vis](https://vis.fitness) iOS app. We think you're gonna to love it.

## Usage

Using this groundbreaking package is easy, as demonstrated by the following example:

```swift
struct JigglingRectangle: View {

  var body: some View {
      RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12, style: .continuous)
        .fill(Color.red)
        .frame(width: 64, height: 64)
        // That's it.
        .jiggling()
    }
    .padding()
  }
}
```

However, for an even jigglier rounded rectangle, one can even set the intensity of the jiggling.

```swift
struct VeryJigglingRectangle: View {

  var body: some View {
      RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12, style: .continuous)
        .fill(Color.red)
        .frame(width: 64, height: 64)
        // Now that's some strong jiggling!
        .jiggling(intensity: .vivacious)
    }
    .padding()
  }
}
```
